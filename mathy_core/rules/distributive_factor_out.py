        `ab + ac = a(b + c)`

         The distributive property can be used to expand out expressions
         to allow for simplification, as well as to factor out common properties
         of terms.

         **Factor out a common term**

         This handles the `ab + ac` conversion of the distributive property, which
         factors out a common term from the given two addition operands.
